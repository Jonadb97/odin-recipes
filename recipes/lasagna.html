    1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
    32 ounces cottage cheese
    3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

Instructions Checklist

    Step 1

    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    Step 2

    Warm a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.
    Step 3

    Mix together cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
    Step 4

    Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Add 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.
    Step 5

    Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
